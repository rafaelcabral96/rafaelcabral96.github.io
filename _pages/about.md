I am a last year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics under the supervision of Professors HÃ¥vard Rue and David Bolin at the [Bayesian Computational Statistics & Modeling group](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/bayescomp) at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en).

As a statistics researcher, I specialize in applied and computational statistics. My research revolves around building more flexible,
robust, and computationally efficient modeling frameworks for spatial and temporal data. Prior to starting the Ph.D., I did internships in the industry in data science, deep neural networks, and image segmentation.

At KAUST, I have also been the teaching assistant of the Stochastic Processes course between 2020 and 2023, and I am the student ambassador of the Statistics program.
