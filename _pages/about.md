I recently obtained a Ph.D. in Statistics at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en) under the supervision of Professors HÃ¥vard Rue and David Bolin. 

As a statistics researcher, I specialize in applied and computational statistics. My research revolves around building more flexible, robust, and computationally efficient modeling frameworks for spatial and temporal data. Prior to starting the Ph.D., I did internships in the industry in data science, deep neural networks, and image segmentation.
