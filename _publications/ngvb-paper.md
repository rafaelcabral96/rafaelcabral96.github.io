title: "Fitting latent non-Gaussian models using variational Bayes and Laplace approximations"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ngvb-paper
excerpt: 'In this paper, we derive variational Bayes algorithms for fast and scalable inference of latent non-Gaussian models. To facilitate Bayesian inference, we introduce the ngvb package, where LGMs implemented in R-INLA can be easily extended to LnGMs by adding a single line of code.'
