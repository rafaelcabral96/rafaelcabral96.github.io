excerpt: 'We propose a new approach for evaluating temporal trends and spatial homogeneity in extremes accounting also for spatial dependence. Wwo novel test statistics provide a way to assess space–time inhomogeneities. Finally, we propose a procedure to achieve stationarity in space and time and evaluate residual extremal dependence over space through a variogram analysis that includes anisotropy.'

We propose a new approach for evaluating temporal trends and spatial homogeneity in extremes accounting also for spatial dependence. Two novel test statistics provide a way to assess space–time inhomogeneities. Finally, we propose a procedure to achieve stationarity in space and time and evaluate residual extremal dependence over space through a variogram analysis that includes anisotropy.
