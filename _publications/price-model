excerpt: 'We propose a price-formation model, with a population consisting of a finite number of agents storing and trading a commodity.  We formulate our problem as an N-player dynamic game with a market-clearing condition. Subsequently, we show how to recast our game as an optimization problem for the overall trading cost. We show the existence of a solution using the direct method in the calculus of variations.'

We propose a price-formation model, with a population consisting of a finite number of agents storing and trading a commodity.  We formulate our problem as an N-player dynamic game with a market-clearing condition. Subsequently, we show how to recast our game as an optimization problem for the overall trading cost. We show the existence of a solution using the direct method in the calculus of variations.
