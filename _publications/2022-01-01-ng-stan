Inferential procedures tend to overestimate the degree of non-Gaussianity in the data and therefore we construct priors that contract the model towards Gaussianity.

In our venture to derive sensible priors, we also propose a new intuitive parameterization of the non-Gaussian models and discuss how to implement them efficiently in Stan. The methods are derived for a generic class of non-Gaussian models that include spatial Matérn fields, autoregressive models for time series, and simultaneous autoregressive models for aerial data.
